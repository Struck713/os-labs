# OSLabs

This is a repository that contains all of the labs that I have done for Dr. Guan's Operating Systems class at Kent State University. 
You can click on the folders in this main part of the repository to visit the assignment page. Each assignment contains a README.md
that you can read to further understand the assignment.
